# Teacher Chat UI Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Old Reference Message Format âœ…
**Problem**: When teachers opened chat threads from teacher-messages.tsx, they were seeing the old long reference chat bubbles instead of the new source bubble format.

**Root Cause**: Old chunk messages starting with "ðŸ“š **Reference" were still in the database and being displayed alongside new messages.

**Solution**: Added filtering in AIChat component to exclude old-style chunk messages:
```typescript
// Filter out old chunk messages to show the new source bubble format
const filteredMessages = messages.filter(msg => 
  !msg.content?.startsWith('ðŸ“š **Reference')
);
```

### 2. Console Log Flooding âœ…
**Problem**: Excessive console logging when switching Student/Teacher toggle to 'Teacher' mode.

**Root Cause**: The `initializeChat` function had verbose logging statements that dumped large amounts of debug information.

**Solution**: Reduced console logging to only essential error messages while maintaining functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Message Filtering
- **Location**: `components/AIChat.tsx`
- **Logic**: Filters out messages that start with "ðŸ“š **Reference" pattern
- **Impact**: Only shows new source bubble format messages to teachers
- **Backward Compatible**: Old messages are hidden but not deleted

### Teacher Mode Interface
- **Student View**: Shows "Chat with:" toggle between AI Assistant and Teacher
- **Teacher View**: Shows reference documents selector instead of mode toggle
- **Navigation**: Teachers access specific student chats via teacher-messages.tsx

### Data Flow for Teacher Chats
1. Teacher clicks on student thread in teacher-messages.tsx
2. Navigates to ai-chat.tsx with `threadId`, `studentId`, and `mode='teacher'`
3. AIChat component initializes existing thread using `initializeExistingThread(threadId)`
4. Messages are filtered to show only new format (excludes old chunk messages)
5. AI messages with sources show new expandable source bubbles

## Testing Completed

- âœ… Teacher can open student chat threads from messages screen
- âœ… Old reference messages are hidden
- âœ… New source bubbles display correctly for AI messages
- âœ… Console logging is minimal and clean
- âœ… No crashes or errors when viewing teacher chats
