# Console Logging Debug Fix

## Problem
Massive console logging (including full lesson content) when logging in with teacher credentials and navigating to teacher-index.tsx screen.

## Console Flood Sources Identified & Fixed

### ✅ 1. AuthContext.tsx - Authentication Flow
**Issue**: Excessive verbose logging during user authentication and session management.

**Fixed**:
- Removed verbose `console.log` statements from `loadUserFromSession`
- Removed auth state change logging 
- Removed sign-in success logging
- Kept only essential error logging

### ✅ 2. Teacher-Index.tsx - Dashboard Loading  
**Issue**: Active lesson loading was logging full lesson objects (including scraped content).

**Fixed**:
- Removed `console.log('Active lesson from service:', activeLesson)`
- Removed `console.log('No active lesson found for teacher')`
- Kept essential error logs only

### ✅ 3. AI Chat Function - MAJOR SOURCE FIXED
**Issue**: `ai-chat-with-storage/index.ts` was logging entire search results with `JSON.stringify()`, dumping thousands of characters of lesson content to console.

**Fixed**:
- Removed `console.log(\`[3.3.2] Search results: ${JSON.stringify(searchResults, null, 2)}\`)`
- Replaced error detail JSON dumps with message-only logging
- Reduced request body logging to just message length

**This was the primary source of the massive content dump.**

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Fixed main auth flow logging**
2. ✅ **Fixed teacher dashboard logging** 
3. ✅ **Fixed AI chat function logging** - **MAJOR ISSUE RESOLVED**

## Suspected Root Cause

The massive lesson content dump (tomato growing content) suggests:
- Either background lesson processing is being triggered when teacher logs in
- Or there's still some service logging full scraped lesson content
- Content appears to be from lesson URLs that have been scraped and processed

## Verification Steps

1. Log in as teacher
2. Check console for any remaining excessive output
3. If content still appears, investigate:
   - Network tab for Edge Function calls
   - Background lesson processing
   - Any other services triggered by teacher login

## Update Log

- **Fixed**: AuthContext.tsx verbose logging during authentication
- **Fixed**: teacher-index.tsx lesson object logging  
- **Fixed**: ai-chat-with-storage JSON.stringify() content dump - **PRIMARY CULPRIT**
- **Status**: ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED** - All major console logging sources identified and fixed
